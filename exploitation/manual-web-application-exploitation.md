## 1. Overview

This exercise simulated a real-world vulnerability assessment scenario in which a publicly accessible web application was identified as running a vulnerable version of third-party software. The objective was to determine whether the vulnerability was exploitable and to validate its impact through controlled manual exploitation.

The assessment resulted in **unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE)** within the application context.

---

## 2. Scope & Constraints

- Target: Intentionally vulnerable web application provided by the training platform  
- Scope: Web application only  
- Authentication: Not required  
- Testing type: Manual exploitation (no automated exploitation frameworks)  

⚠️ *All testing was performed in a controlled lab environment with explicit authorization.*

---

## 3. Methodology

The assessment followed a standard exploitation workflow:

1. Application enumeration and version identification  
2. Vulnerability research and validation  
3. Manual exploit selection and adaptation  
4. Controlled exploitation  
5. Impact verification  

This mirrors how vulnerability validation is performed during real penetration tests.

---

## 4. Enumeration & Discovery

Initial reconnaissance focused on identifying the application type and version.

High-level actions included:
- Browsing application functionality
- Reviewing exposed endpoints and responses
- Identifying application metadata revealing the software version

The identified version was confirmed to be **affected by a publicly disclosed vulnerability**.

---

## 5. Vulnerability Research

After confirming the application version, public vulnerability databases were consulted to determine whether known exploits existed.

The research process involved:
- Searching for vulnerabilities matching the identified software and version
- Reviewing exploit descriptions to assess applicability
- Confirming exploit prerequisites matched the target environment

Only publicly documented vulnerabilities were considered.

---

## 6. Exploitation (High-Level)

A relevant exploit was selected and executed **manually** to validate exploitability.

Important notes:
- Exploit logic was reviewed before execution
- No exploit code is reproduced in this write-up
- Execution was limited to confirming code execution capability

Successful exploitation resulted in the ability to execute commands within the application context, confirming **remote code execution**.

---

## 7. Impact Assessment

**Vulnerability Type:**  
Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Severity:**  
**Critical**

**Impact:**  
If exploited in a real-world environment, this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary commands on the server
- Fully compromise the application
- Access sensitive data
- Use the system as a pivot point for further attacks

This represents a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

## 8. Evidence of Exploitation

Evidence was obtained by:
- Successfully executing commands on the target system
- Retrieving a proof value (flag) to confirm impact

⚠️ *Specific command output and flags are intentionally omitted.*

---

## 9. Root Cause Analysis

The vulnerability existed due to:
- Use of an outdated and vulnerable third-party application
- Lack of patch management
- Absence of compensating controls to restrict unauthenticated access

---

## 10. Remediation Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability:

- **Immediately update** the affected application to a patched version
- Implement a **patch management process** for third-party software
- Restrict application exposure where possible
- Monitor public vulnerability disclosures relevant to deployed software
- Conduct regular security testing to identify outdated components

---

## 11. Key Takeaway

This exercise reinforced that effective exploitation is not about running tools blindly, but about:
- Identifying vulnerable software
- Understanding exploit applicability
- Validating impact safely and responsibly

Manual exploitation remains a critical skill in real penetration testing engagements.
