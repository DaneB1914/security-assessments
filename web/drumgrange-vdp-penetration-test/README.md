# Drumgrange Ltd – Vulnerability Disclosure Program Penetration Test
**Audience:** Recruiters, hiring managers, and security professionals reviewing practical penetration testing methodology and reporting skills.

## Overview

This repository documents a **scope-authorized penetration testing engagement** conducted against Drumgrange Ltd assets as part of their public Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) hosted on HackerOne.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate **real-world penetration testing methodology**, professional judgment, and ethical testing practices — not simply tool usage or vulnerability discovery.

All testing was performed **unauthenticated**, **non-intrusively**, and strictly within the published scope.

---

## Engagement Highlights

- ✔ Explicit authorization via HackerOne VDP
- ✔ Strict scope validation and enforcement
- ✔ Passive reconnaissance and asset classification
- ✔ Targeted content discovery
- ✔ HTTP and security header analysis
- ✔ Unauthenticated application behavior testing
- ✔ Federated authentication flow observation
- ✔ Professional reporting with documented restraint

No vulnerabilities were identified within the authorized scope. This outcome reflects **effective baseline security controls**, not incomplete testing.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Scope validation & authorization handling
- Passive reconnaissance (OSINT-driven)
- Web asset classification
- Directory and content enumeration
- HTTP & security header analysis
- Federated authentication flow analysis
- False-positive avoidance
- Professional penetration testing reporting

## Why This Project Matters

In real consulting environments, penetration testing is as much about:
- knowing **what not to test**,
- avoiding **false positives**, and
- respecting **legal and ethical boundaries**

as it is about finding vulnerabilities.

This engagement demonstrates:
- disciplined methodology,
- careful decision-making,
- and clear technical communication.

No vulnerabilities were identified within scope. This outcome reflects effective baseline security controls rather than incomplete testing.
